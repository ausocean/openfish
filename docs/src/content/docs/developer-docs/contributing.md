**Authors:** Scott Barnard

Hi there! üëã We‚Äôre thrilled that you‚Äôre interested in contributing to OpenFish, our open-source project dedicated to classifying marine species. 

Before diving in, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our guidelines. These will help streamline the contribution process and ensure a smooth collaboration. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

## Raising issues.
If you find a bug or want to request a feature, please raise an issue https://github.com/ausocean/openfish/issues.

For bugs, try to include any information that you think is helpful in describing the problem and ideally the steps you need to reproduce the issue. The better the information you include, the quicker it is likely to be fixed.

Use the labels `document`, `bug` and `enhancement` to categorize your issue.

## Choosing an issue to work on.
Issues with the `good first issue` label are a good choice for your first contribution.

## Repo Setup
If you want to contribute code to the project, use these steps instead to get started:

### Prerequisites
You will need installed:
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en) v19.2.0 or later
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v8.5.1 or later
- [go](https://go.dev/) 1.20 or later
- Linux (Windows is currently untested but may work)

### Steps:
1) Setup google cloud credentials so your application can access the datastore:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project openfish-dev
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   if the environment variable `$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is not set:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json
   ```

2) Install npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3) Start the API:
   ```bash
   go run ./api
   ```

4) Start the webapp using vite's development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter ./openfish-webapp dev
   ```

5) Open the browser and visit http://localhost:5173/watch.html.

6) (Optional) Serve the documentation website using:
    ```bash
    pnpm --filter ./docs dev
    ```

## Common tasks
### Formatting code
::: code-group
```bash [Back-end project]
go fmt ./... && swag fmt
```
```bash [Front-end project]
pnpm --filter webapp fmt
```
:::

### Running unit tests
::: code-group
```bash [Back-end project]
go test -v ./... -short  
```

### Linting (Front-end only)
::: code-group
```bash [Checking code]
pnpm --filter webapp check
```
```bash [Applying fixes automatically]
pnpm --filter webapp check --fix
```
:::
