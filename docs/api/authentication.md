# Authentication
**Authors:** Scott Barnard

OpenFish has optional support for requiring user authentication. 

User authentication is provided using gcloud IAP. By default it is disabled, you need to pass the command line flag --iap or set the environmental argument IAP="true" to enable it.

Command line flags and environmental arguments can now both be used to configure options.
