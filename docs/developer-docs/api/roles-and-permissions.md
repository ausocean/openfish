Users can have the following roles and permissions:

### Admin role
Admins are able to add and remove annotations, videostreams, capturesources, users, and species.

### Curator role
A curator can select streams for classification. An example of when this is useful: for teachers who could choose streams for their students to classify

### Annotator role
By default users are given the annotator role, which lets them add annotations, and delete their own annotations.

### Readonly role
A readonly user is only be able to look at annotations, not make any.
